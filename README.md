"# shuaibr.com" 

This is a project I worked on in February 2018 to January 2020. This was a really interesting personal project because I focused on aesthetics and presentation rather than complicated solutions. I referenced this website from HTML5 template but changed almost all of the source code.
I'll update this repo from time to time and maybe host it at some point in the future. 


Thanks for reading,
SR
